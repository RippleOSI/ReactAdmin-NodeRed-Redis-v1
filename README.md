# General

The main purpose of this project is demonstration of workability of application based on two technologies:
1) Client side on React-Admin framework;
2) Server side on Node-Red tool.

# React-Admin

React-Admin is a framework based on ReactJS-library. Basis functionality of this tool is adaptated to create the client side of CMS.

It was developed and maintains by french Marmelab company.

Tutorial for React-Admin framework is available by this link:

# Node-Red 

Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.
                                                                          
It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

It was developed by IBMâ€™s Emerging Technology Services team and now a part of the JS Foundation.

# Redis

We are combining **NodeRed** and **Redis** as separate elements in this project.

**Redis** is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. More information about this technology is presented by this link: https://redis.io/ 
  

# Installation

This application is available by GitHub link:
https://github.com/RippleOSI/ReactAdmin-NodeRed-Redis-v1

Create a directory for your application:
```
$ mkdir RA-NR-demo

```

Clone the project from GitHub:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RippleOSI/ReactAdmin-NodeRed-Redis-v1 .
```

Install all required dependencies:
```
$ cd RA-NR-demo
$ npm install
```

Run the application locally:
``` 
$ npm start
```

After this application is available at your local machine by the link http://[localhost]:3000, but your application can't work because server side hasn't been installed yet.

You should install Node-Red at your local machine:
``` 
$ docker run -it -d -p 1880:1880 --name my-nodered nodered/node-red-docker
$ docker exec -it my-nodered bash
$ npm install node-red-contrib-redis
$ exit
$ docker stop my-nodered
$ docker start my-nodered
$ docker run -it -p 6379:6379 -d -v 'DIRECTORY_PATH'/redis.conf:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf --name my-redis redis redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
``` 

Node-Red is available by this link: http://[localhost]:1880

For this reason you should define domain name in the `public/index.html` file:

```
<html>
    <head>
    ...
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
          window.config = {
            domainName: "http://[my-localhost-name]:1880"
          }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

After this you should import required flows to your local Node-Red. Flows are located inside your project in the **/flows** directory.
